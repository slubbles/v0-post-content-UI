      "PostContent is an AI-powered content generation tool for social media. It helps you create engaging posts, replies, and threads in seconds while maintaining your unique voice and style.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI training work?",
    answer:
      "Our AI training feature analyzes samples of your existing writing to learn your unique voice, tone, and style. The more examples you provide, the better the AI becomes at generating content that sounds like you.",
  },

    question: "What are credits and how do they work?",
    answer:
      "Credits are used each time you generate content. Each generation costs 1 credit. Free accounts get 10 credits per month, Pro accounts get 200 credits, and Enterprise accounts get unlimited credits. Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period, and you won't be charged again.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my generated content?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we store your generated content in your history so you can access it later. You can view, copy, or delete any generated content from your history page. You can also download all your data from your account settings.",
  },

    question: "What platforms do you support?",
    answer:

    question: "Do you offer a free plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Every new account starts with a free plan that includes 10 credits per month. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time to get more credits and advanced features.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Generally, because each model call incurs a cost, we aren't offering refunds at this time. If you have a specific case where something unusual happened, please reach out to our team and we'll be happy to help.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer team or agency plans?",
    answer:
