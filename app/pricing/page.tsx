                  One click = one generation = one credit used. Each generation automatically gives you multiple
                  variants to choose from (3 on Free, 5 on Pro, unlimited on Enterprise). Think of it as: you pay once,
                  we give you multiple options. Pick the best one, or regenerate if you want different takes.

                  Absolutely. Launch week? Scale up. Vacation month? Scale down. Life happens. Your billing should
                  adapt. No contracts, no penalties, no awkward conversations with sales. Just instant changes that work
                  for YOU.

                  Your account stays active, your history is safe. Upgrade instantly for more credits or wait for your
                  monthly refresh. We'll never hold your content hostage. Once you create it, it's yours forever—even if
                  you downgrade to free.

                <AccordionContent>
                  Because ChatGPT doesn't know YOUR voice. It sounds generic, robotic, fake. PostContent trains on YOUR
                  writing style so every post sounds authentically you. Plus: no copy-pasting, no prompt engineering, no
                  15-minute detours. Just instant, on-brand content.
